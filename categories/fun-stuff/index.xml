      <description>This is a reply to http://thinkvitamin.com/dev/the-perfect-development-environment/
Work Setting I prefer to be alone, with no one walking around, having conversations on the phone or asking questions. And yes, barking dogs are bad while you try to focus on source code^^
If people can not keep their mouth shut, loud music helps a lot. Use the headphones, whenever other people are around.
If you do an on-site consulting job, better not keep the client from asking questions though: This is what he (or she) pays for!</description>

      <description>This is how much money I spent each month for Starbucks coffee&amp;#8230; other than expected, it&amp;#8217;s more in summer and less in winter:</description>

      <title>Quadcore processors are useful for Web developers</title>

      <description>Every now and then you read, that the maximum you need on a desktop are two cores and that quadcore mainly is a nice marketing idea. That&amp;#8217;s probably true, if you use Word or Games mainly. For Word, even an Intel Atom processor is enough. As a Web developer which usually has some batch jobs running, a database, memached, Eclipse, Firefox and VMware with Windows to do tests, you will see that the four cores are worth the money, however!</description>

      <description>How cool is that?

Update: The original article on ananova.com is not available anymore. Not sure what company is building the dolphin submarine. All I got is this picture! Sorry.
Update 2: If you&amp;#8217;re interested to buy one or want more technical specs, have a look at http://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/dolphin-power-boat or http://seabreacher.com/</description>

      <title>Java Recruiting</title>

      <description>From http://ask.slashdot.org/askslashdot/08/09/01/1246201.shtml:
 Recruiting for Java posts is a minefield &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s full of people who should be stacking shelves in a supermarket. If you want a Java job, just update your resume to say that you know Java. I have met lots of J2EE experts at work, who would not be able to code a &amp;#8220;Hello World&amp;#8221; program, if their jobs depended on it. Also learn lots of buzz words.</description>
