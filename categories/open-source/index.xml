      <title>Cloud9 IDE: My first impression</title>

      <description>After I could gather some experience with Cloud9 IDE today, I&amp;#8217;m in the process of customizing it to my needs. For example, the run and preview buttons seem useless when using Cloud9 as editor only: Most PHP/JavaScript Web apps are constantly running in another tab anyways and usually don&amp;#8217;t require compilation (as a developer, I know how to use the reload button).
The basic editor settings are accessible via Preferences and/or the Views menu.</description>

      <title>Howto: Install Cloud9 IDE on CentOS 6.3 / Linux</title>

      <description>There is an interesting (and free) alternative for those who are sick of (re-)installing Eclipse, Aptana, Zend Studio, PhpStorm, NetBeans or other IDEs on each new computer they use &amp;#8211; or for those who don&amp;#8217;t have 1 GB of RAM left to waste just to run a source code editor. I used to work with gedit mainly for performance reasons, but this option is (sadly) not viable on OS X (there is a working gedit version for OS X, but IMHO it is not really usable in practice).</description>

      <title>Git: A hellish nightmare!</title>

      <description>Even though I am the master of procrastination, I managed to fix 3 issues in flot (JS charting plugin for jQuery) and PHPUnit this week. Of course they are hosted on github and everyone who knows me, knows that I hate git because it is sooo different from svn and my brain frequently explodes when I see all the branches and connections between them. Every time I try to explain that to more or less experienced git users, they try to convince me from the opposite.</description>

      <title>How to contribute to JavaScriptMVC 3.0</title>

      <description>If you are reading this, I can safely assume you know what JavaScriptMVC (JMVC) is, what its features are, and what components it consists of, namely:
 FuncUnit (the test framework) DocumentJS (the documentation engine) jQuery (JavaScriptMVC uses a special fork with added bugfixes) JavaScriptMVC (the core framework) Steal (the code manager / script loader; sometimes referred to as “StealJS”) Phui (component library for JavaScriptMVC, not part of the core)  These partly independent components (together with Selenium) are bundled using git submodules (http://book.</description>

      <title>AWF-CMS.org online again</title>

      <description>Ha, after almost 3 years, the home page of my (so far) biggest Open Source project AWF-CMS is online again. When I started working for Zend in 2006&amp;frasl;2007, I felt the need to write a version that is based on Zend Framework. Of course I was busy with my customer projects, so that never happened. Even worse, due to a server upgrade, the configuration for the AWF Web site was broken and I didn&amp;#8217;t even find the time to fix that until today.</description>

      <title>JavaScriptMVC 1.5 released</title>
      <link>https://blog.liquidbytes.net/2009/02/javascriptmvc-15-released/</link>

      <description>A new stable release of the JavaScriptMVC framework was released yesterday :) Justin Meyer developed it, while working with us on a new Web application. Some features like the new custom events are direct results of this project. He did an excellent job!
New features include:
 Env.js/Shrinksafe based compression: A custom env to simulate the browser. As the browser encounters script tags, it adds them to a collection and then compresses them.</description>

      <title>JavaScript Components</title>
      <link>https://blog.liquidbytes.net/2008/07/javascript-components/</link>

      <description>My blog was a calm place for a while now, because I&amp;#8217;m terribly busy with writing code (like it should be&amp;#8230;). With this posting, I want to present the prototype of JavaScript Components, which are comparable to Swing Components in Java. They make use of the Composite Pattern. That means every Component can act as a container for other Components. Together with Models, Views and a Controller (Event Dispatcher), they can form reusable widgets.</description>

      <title>Updated version of Zend_Db_Adapter_Odbtp_Mssql</title>

      <description>As people start asking me about that ODBTP adapter for Zend Framework, I will publish it as attachment to this post now. It should work with the latest version of Zend Framework (as reported by a developer). If you want to use it, just copy the files to your include path (make sure the path comes before the ZF path). Of course, you need to install ODBTP as well and add extension=php_odbtp_mssql.</description>

      <description>Today, I installed Privoxy &amp;#8211; a non-caching proxy that filters unwanted content, such as ads and cookies. Jeden Tag eine gute Tat, wie man im Deutschen sagt. It works just great! Here&amp;#8217;s a little howto, if you want to build it from source on a Linux box (a Windows version with installer is available as well). Check the download page on sourceforge.net for the latest release &amp;#8211; at the moment it is 3.</description>

      <title>Flickr RSS plugin for jQuery</title>
      <link>https://blog.liquidbytes.net/2008/05/flickr-rss-feed-plugin-for-jquery-and-wordpress/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.liquidbytes.net/2008/05/flickr-rss-feed-plugin-for-jquery-and-wordpress/</guid>
      <description>After searching for a suitable Flickr WordPress plugin for ages, I developed my own in less than 40 lines of JavaScript code. It&amp;#8217;s free! You may download and use it for your own blog. I recommend to save it as /wp-content/plugins/flickr/flickr.js, if you are using WordPress. As the plugin does not depend on WordPress, you can use it with any other CMS like Drupal too. Even with plain HTML, if you like.</description>

      <title>Zend Framework: Unicode DB adapter for SQL Server</title>
      <link>https://blog.liquidbytes.net/2007/05/odbtp-adapter-zend-framework/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.liquidbytes.net/2007/05/odbtp-adapter-zend-framework/</guid>
      <description>Yeah, I finally got it managed to publish my proposal for the Zend Framwork ODBTP database adapter component:
http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Db_Adapter_Odbtp_Mssql
The default MS SQL database driver does not work with Unicode, as SQL Server expects Unicode strings in the UCS-2 encoding (UCS-2 contains null bytes and the driver is not binary-safe). ODBTP works as layer between PHP and SQL Server and accepts Unicode strings in the UTF-8 encoding.
The required classes are attached bellow.</description>
