        <div>Today, I&#8217;ve been evaluating popular hosted CI services to see how well they&#8217;re working with PHP and how much they cost.
drone.io https://drone.io/
drone.io is free for Open Source projects (one concurrent build). Paid plans for private repositories start at 25 $ / month. Builds are configured on the Web site. PHP support is marked as &#8220;beta&#8221; for good reasons: PHP 5.5.1 and composer are pretty much outdated. By default, builds are triggered by commits to all branches (can be limited).</div>

        <div>This is a follow-up on Why I’m using a separate layer for input data validation that explains the key differences between client-side, input value (form) and model validation.
In general, model validation operates on trusted data (internal system state) and should ideally be repeatable at any point in time while input validation explicitly operates once on data that comes from untrusted sources (depending on the use case and user privileges).</div>

        <div>I just came across a question concerning Symfony 2 bundles and testability on Stack Overflow that I would like to share with you.

When using Symfony, inexperienced or insecure developers tend to use lots of existing bundles, because this seems to be the recommend way of building an application. Later, they wonder, why it&#8217;s so hard to write unit and component tests or they write functional tests instead and call them unit tests, because this really seems to be the only possible way to write tests.</div>

        <div>Make sure the directories /usr/local, /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin exist and check the permissions, so that regular users can access them. This should already be the case, if you got Homebrew installed and working.
Open _~/.bashprofile and check, if /usr/local/bin and _/usr/local/sbin_ are properly added to your PATH environment variable:
export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH" If there is no _~/.bashprofile yet, simply create it (see Mac OS X configuration for software developers).
Since using Homebrew seems overly complicated and you&#8217;ll get an outdated version (5.</div>

To avoid conflicts, it is generally not recommended to use Homebrew alongside other external OS X package managers such as MacPorts or Fink. You can remove MacPorts with these Terminal commands:
sudo port -f uninstall installed sudo rm -rf /opt/local sudo rm -rf /Applications/DarwinPorts If you prefer to stay with MacPorts: There is a blog post with a detailed howto for PHP 5.</div>

        <div>During the last couple of days, I&#8217;ve been updating my posting about cargo cult coding standards for PHP. There are some examples now. Thanks to Arturas Smorgun for retweeting it. I&#8217;m sure my post doesn&#8217;t have a huge impact on the community, but for me it&#8217;s still worth talking about my experiences.
Guess what&#8217;s bothering me the most is that the popular PEAR/Zend Framework coding standard actually forces you to lose the context of your currently edited code.</div>

        <div>Cargo cult means that you copy some (previously) successful behavior from others and expect something good to happen to you (or your project) as well. For coding standards, that&#8217;s a very good starting point. Especially since formatting standards are often not based on any science &#8211; life is just easier, if everyone is using the same formatting for source code and we all hate the discussions at the start of projects, when some junior developer tries to promote it&#8217;s own fancy ideas.</div>

        <div>This is a reply to http://100days.de/serendipity/archives/50-Notification-Free-PHP-Coding.html. Gaylord Aulke&#8217;s opinions are normally quite valuable. There are a couple of arguments (just read the comments) in both directions and to be fair, Gaylord also said, that his opinion is different for frameworks and libraries.
Even though I tend look into PHP notifications (some code produces so much of them, that you can only ignore them), I wasn&#8217;t really sure what my final position on Notification Free PHP Coding is and I was not too strict about it.</div>

        <div>Ha, after almost 3 years, the home page of my (so far) biggest Open Source project AWF-CMS is online again. When I started working for Zend in 2006&frasl;2007, I felt the need to write a version that is based on Zend Framework. Of course I was busy with my customer projects, so that never happened. Even worse, due to a server upgrade, the configuration for the AWF Web site was broken and I didn&#8217;t even find the time to fix that until today.</div>
