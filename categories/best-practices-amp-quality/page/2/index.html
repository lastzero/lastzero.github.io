        <div>There is a subtle difference between what Robert C. Martin recommends in Clean Code and what Andrew Hunt / David Thomas recommend in The Pragmatic Programmer. Martin encourages you to always use exceptions if the normal program flow is interrupted to avoid if statements (or even worse: forgotten if statements and mixed result types) while Hunt/Thomas say this can cause harm (&#8220;it&#8217;s a kind of cascading goto&#8221;) and should only be used if something truly unexpected happens (tip 34).</div>

        <div>What does passion mean for a Software Engineer? Depends on the context. First, and that&#8217;s what start-up companies usually expect from their employes, it means you love the company, the business idea and the team you work with. Some people are also passionate about their Apple computer/phone/tablet in a similar way (the term &#8220;Fanboy&#8221; is frequently used in Web forums to describe this behavior). *
Second, it can mean that you stay ahead of the curve and have strong opinions about how to do your job (independent from the company you&#8217;re currently working for): For example, I&#8217;m obsessed with clean code and unit tests.</div>

Caffeine &#8220;There is no doubt that some of us can make more efficient use of our focus-manna by consuming moderate amounts of caffeine. But take care. Caffeine also puts a strange jitter on our focus.&#8221;
Arrogance &#8220;Programmers tend to be arrogant, self-absorbed introverts.We didn&#8217;t go into this business because we like people. Most of us got into programming because we prefer to deeply focus on sterile minutia, juggle lots of concepts simultaneously, and in general prove to ourselves that we have brains the size of a planet, all while not having to interact with the messy complexities of other people.</div>

        <div>During the last couple of days, I&#8217;ve been updating my posting about cargo cult coding standards for PHP. There are some examples now. Thanks to Arturas Smorgun for retweeting it. I&#8217;m sure my post doesn&#8217;t have a huge impact on the community, but for me it&#8217;s still worth talking about my experiences.
Guess what&#8217;s bothering me the most is that the popular PEAR/Zend Framework coding standard actually forces you to lose the context of your currently edited code.</div>

        <div>Cargo cult means that you copy some (previously) successful behavior from others and expect something good to happen to you (or your project) as well. For coding standards, that&#8217;s a very good starting point. Especially since formatting standards are often not based on any science &#8211; life is just easier, if everyone is using the same formatting for source code and we all hate the discussions at the start of projects, when some junior developer tries to promote it&#8217;s own fancy ideas.</div>

        <div>An analysis of 32 factors that influence the software development estimation accuracy can be found in Computer’s October issue (Dirk Basten, Ali Sunyaev, pp. 88-90).
In my opinion, these are the most important results:
 Try to exclude candidates with a high general degree of optimism as well as optimism in the estimation process Split larger tasks into smaller ones, which can usually be estimated more precisely Communicate frequently with the client to obtain direct feedback Estimator experience is one of the most important factors in archiving development effort estimation accuracy, although it&#8217;s impractical to appoint the highest-qualified estimator on every project  </div>

        <div>Introduction There is a general rule in software development, which says you should avoid duplicated code and data. This is extremely simple to remember and many developers love to quote it. Popular code quality assessment tools use it as a metric. Because this rule sounds so inerrable, it is applied even in cases, where it is not appropriate for one or more reasons.
Another well-known fact is that inexperienced developers like to duplicate everything using copy &amp; paste, which causes a lot of maintenance overhead afterwards.</div>

        <div>This is a reply to http://100days.de/serendipity/archives/50-Notification-Free-PHP-Coding.html. Gaylord Aulke&#8217;s opinions are normally quite valuable. There are a couple of arguments (just read the comments) in both directions and to be fair, Gaylord also said, that his opinion is different for frameworks and libraries.
Even though I tend look into PHP notifications (some code produces so much of them, that you can only ignore them), I wasn&#8217;t really sure what my final position on Notification Free PHP Coding is and I was not too strict about it.</div>

Work Setting I prefer to be alone, with no one walking around, having conversations on the phone or asking questions. And yes, barking dogs are bad while you try to focus on source code^^
If people can not keep their mouth shut, loud music helps a lot. Use the headphones, whenever other people are around.
If you do an on-site consulting job, better not keep the client from asking questions though: This is what he (or she) pays for!</div>

        <div>I was totally enthusiastic, when I first learned about JavaScriptMVC &#8211; because it brings all the best practices you are accustomed to into the JavaScript world. That means the MVC architecture, Object-oriented development with simulated inheritance, EJS templates, easy testing, OpenAjax support, powerful event delegation and so on.
However, I often have a hard time to convince other developers about those advantages. I guess testing is the easiest one, because no developer would dare to argue against testing, even though many developers don&#8217;t do it or don&#8217;t do it right.</div>
