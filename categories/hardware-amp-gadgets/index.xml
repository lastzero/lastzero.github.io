      <description>I could not find a single correct and useful description how to get the Gobiâ„¢ 2000 PCI Express Mini Card, that is built into some Lenovo ThinkPad X100e models, to work with Ubuntu Linux 10.04 LTS &amp;#8220;Lucid Lynx&amp;#8221; on Google (which is identical to the Internet). Therefore I want to share my knowledge with you, before I forget everything. This howto might also work for other notebooks that use the same WWAN/UMTS/3G card (like the ThinkPad T410).</description>

      <description>I was getting ready to pack my monitor up to move it the other day, and I pushed the release button for the mount on the monitor stand. A second or two after the monitor was disengaged from the stand, I heard a loud &amp;#8220;twang&amp;#8221; coming from the stand. I didn&amp;#8217;t think much of it because it looked fine, but later on I found it was stuck, in the lowest position.</description>
