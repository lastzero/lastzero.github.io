      <description>Since I&amp;#8217;m not going to church, I need to write things down in my blog to let go. Probably every freelancer knows this: You&amp;#8217;re being contacted by recruiters that want to sell you a permanent position at their amazing company. So, how amazing can it be? Let&amp;#8217;s see.
First of all some facts. As a freelancer in Germany, you can easily make 85K a year, considering you work full time for 11 months and got a very affordable hourly rate of 60 EUR and 10K of expenses.</description>

      <description>If you own a software company or work there in HR, it is your goal to hire the best engineers for your business. So you certainly don&amp;#8217;t want to mess up the recruitment process. As someone who&amp;#8217;s in the industry for two decades (sitting on both sides of the table), I would like to share a few points about how to make an interview a positive and insightful experience for everyone.</description>

      <title>Java Recruiting</title>

      <description>From http://ask.slashdot.org/askslashdot/08/09/01/1246201.shtml:
 Recruiting for Java posts is a minefield &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s full of people who should be stacking shelves in a supermarket. If you want a Java job, just update your resume to say that you know Java. I have met lots of J2EE experts at work, who would not be able to code a &amp;#8220;Hello World&amp;#8221; program, if their jobs depended on it. Also learn lots of buzz words.</description>

      <description>One more post for today! :) As you might know, Elliot Schrage leaves Google to join facebook. There seem to me more and more Google employees running away and working for other companies now. While searching for more details about the latest news, I found this:
 Commenter Facebookcanhavehim shares this thought on Google überflack Elliot Schrage&amp;#8217;s prospective departure for Facebook:It has nothing to do with Eric&amp;#8217;s philandering. It has everything to do with the fact that Elliot sucks and is being run out of the company.</description>
