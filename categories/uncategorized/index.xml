      <description>Until recently I had my own mail server running&amp;#8230; good old Postfix and dbmail&amp;#8230; as I ran out of time (and administration of a mail server simply takes some time), I had to look for another solution. The evaluation showed, that Google Mail is not more expensive than other services like GMX, but I can continue using my own domains and they have the best Web frontend. Also I assumed, that Google might send some spam to other providers (this is part 1 of the story) but not accept spam&amp;#8230; I was convinced that Google has the best spam filters in the world&amp;#8230; to recongnize spam is related to artificial intelligence and smart alogorithms&amp;#8230; like Web search&amp;#8230; what shall I say?</description>
