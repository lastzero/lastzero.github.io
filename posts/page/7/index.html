        <div>Well, it&#8217;s official. Apple has now announced it&#8217;s bringing the
App Store concept to the Mac and it looks like they&#8217;ll be
restricting apps with FairPlay DRM too for good measure. When we
first began talking about the problems with the App Store on the
iPhone and iPod Touch, people wanted us to drop it and stop
talking about the DRM tricks being pulled by Apple on the grounds</div>

        <div>If you are reading this, I can safely assume you know what JavaScriptMVC (JMVC) is, what its features are, and what components it consists of, namely:
 FuncUnit (the test framework) DocumentJS (the documentation engine) jQuery (JavaScriptMVC uses a special fork with added bugfixes) JavaScriptMVC (the core framework) Steal (the code manager / script loader; sometimes referred to as “StealJS”) Phui (component library for JavaScriptMVC, not part of the core)  These partly independent components (together with Selenium) are bundled using git submodules (http://book.</div>

http://www.ape-project.org/
Even though the authors say it&#8217;s a stable 1.0 release and &#8220;insanely great&#8221;, there are some issues you should be aware of. I write this in the hope that it helps others to evaluate the server and to give feedback to the developers. The general idea of combining fast C code with JavaScript is very good.</div>

        <div>Just one short note, before I go to bed.
At FrOSCon I saw the talk about the NoSQL database Cassandra. The guy was pretty convincing. He also said, SQL joins are slow and cumbersome for some use cases (his example was Twitter). Then his slides showed how nicely Cassandra can provide the same data as some kind of materialized view that is constantly updated after data changes. And how secure the storage is with multiple backups and smart fail-safe mechanisms.</div>

        <div>This is a reply to http://100days.de/serendipity/archives/50-Notification-Free-PHP-Coding.html. Gaylord Aulke&#8217;s opinions are normally quite valuable. There are a couple of arguments (just read the comments) in both directions and to be fair, Gaylord also said, that his opinion is different for frameworks and libraries.
Even though I tend look into PHP notifications (some code produces so much of them, that you can only ignore them), I wasn&#8217;t really sure what my final position on Notification Free PHP Coding is and I was not too strict about it.</div>

Work Setting I prefer to be alone, with no one walking around, having conversations on the phone or asking questions. And yes, barking dogs are bad while you try to focus on source code^^
If people can not keep their mouth shut, loud music helps a lot. Use the headphones, whenever other people are around.
If you do an on-site consulting job, better not keep the client from asking questions though: This is what he (or she) pays for!</div>

        <div>Ha, after almost 3 years, the home page of my (so far) biggest Open Source project AWF-CMS is online again. When I started working for Zend in 2006&frasl;2007, I felt the need to write a version that is based on Zend Framework. Of course I was busy with my customer projects, so that never happened. Even worse, due to a server upgrade, the configuration for the AWF Web site was broken and I didn&#8217;t even find the time to fix that until today.</div>

        <div>I was totally enthusiastic, when I first learned about JavaScriptMVC &#8211; because it brings all the best practices you are accustomed to into the JavaScript world. That means the MVC architecture, Object-oriented development with simulated inheritance, EJS templates, easy testing, OpenAjax support, powerful event delegation and so on.
However, I often have a hard time to convince other developers about those advantages. I guess testing is the easiest one, because no developer would dare to argue against testing, even though many developers don&#8217;t do it or don&#8217;t do it right.</div>

        <div>Argh, I spent the whole day figuring out how to connect to the VPN of my current customer. The Windows client on my other computer works just fine, at least after selecting the UDP option. But it is quite some overhead to install Windows on my Linux box just to connect to a VPN. The proprietary Cisco VPN client for Linux works until kernel version 2.6.25 AFAIK. Therefore, this is no option for all users of Ubuntu 10.</div>
