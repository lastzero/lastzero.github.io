      <description>I was totally enthusiastic, when I first learned about JavaScriptMVC &amp;#8211; because it brings all the best practices you are accustomed to into the JavaScript world.

However, I often have a hard time to convince other developers about those advantages. I guess testing is the easiest one, because no developer would dare to argue against testing, even though many developers don&amp;#8217;t do it or don&amp;#8217;t do it right.</description>
