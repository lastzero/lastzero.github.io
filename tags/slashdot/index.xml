      <description>From http://ask.slashdot.org/askslashdot/08/09/01/1246201.shtml:
 Recruiting for Java posts is a minefield &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s full of people who should be stacking shelves in a supermarket. If you want a Java job, just update your resume to say that you know Java. I have met lots of J2EE experts at work, who would not be able to code a &amp;#8220;Hello World&amp;#8221; program, if their jobs depended on it. Also learn lots of buzz words.</description>

      <description>As you can see from my recent postings, the submission on Slashdot asking Has Google Lost Its Mojo? is no surprise to me. Here&amp;#8217;s an interesting comment:
 Speaking as a Googler, &amp;#8220;some&amp;#8221; is an understatement. The best and brightest have been exiting Google at the earliest for months, leaving behind the political climbers, backbiters and the just plain incompetent. Now Google mainly runs on interns, everybody else is too &amp;#8220;smart&amp;#8221; to do the grunt work like coding, debugging, or much at all beyond getting face time.</description>
