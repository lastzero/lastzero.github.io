      <description>It is always interesting to see, what we &amp;#8220;forgot&amp;#8221; during history. One of the these things is, without a doubt, Cybernetics (which in turn is a child of the 2nd world war) and maybe even the origin of computers (see von Neumann architecture), which is closely coupled to that.
While passing by a second-hand bookstore in Evanston, IL I saw the book Psycho-Cybernetics in the window, which was published in 1960, 12 years after Cybernetics was published by Norbert Wiener.</description>

      <description>In IEEE Spectrum 12.10 you find an article about building &amp;#8220;The brain of a New Machine&amp;#8221; using Memristors by Versace &amp;amp; Chandler. Bottom line is that they expect that a new memory technology built on the Memristor chips produced by HP Labs enables them to construct massive-parallel computers that consume only a comparable small amount of energy. While this might be the case, the article does not really answer the question how the software that runs on that hardware looks like.</description>

      <description>While being in Chicago I found the time to read through the last issue of Communications. Here&amp;#8217;s a short summary:
 &amp;#8220;Where have all the workshops gone?&amp;#8221; by Moshe Y. Vardi &amp;#8211; he basically complains that todays workshops (&amp;#8220;second-rate conferences&amp;#8221;) are not the same as they have been in the past (&amp;#8220;informal gatherings of researchers&amp;#8221;). My suggestion: Go to an Unconference, although these are more informal gatherings of engineers, rather than researchers.</description>
