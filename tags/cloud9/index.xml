      <description>After I could gather some experience with Cloud9 IDE today, I&amp;#8217;m in the process of customizing it to my needs. For example, the run and preview buttons seem useless when using Cloud9 as editor only: Most PHP/JavaScript Web apps are constantly running in another tab anyways and usually don&amp;#8217;t require compilation (as a developer, I know how to use the reload button).
The basic editor settings are accessible via Preferences and/or the Views menu.</description>

      <description>There is an interesting (and free) alternative for those who are sick of (re-)installing Eclipse, Aptana, Zend Studio, PhpStorm, NetBeans or other IDEs on each new computer they use &amp;#8211; or for those who don&amp;#8217;t have 1 GB of RAM left to waste just to run a source code editor. I used to work with gedit mainly for performance reasons, but this option is (sadly) not viable on OS X (there is a working gedit version for OS X, but IMHO it is not really usable in practice).</description>
