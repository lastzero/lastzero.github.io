      <description>Did you know that JavaScriptMVC comes with a very powerful file loader / dependency management system? It can be used independently of the MVC framework and is (in my opinion) much better than anything else I&amp;#8217;ve seen (including RequireJS). It is not marketed as a stand-alone tool, which probably is the reason people don&amp;#8217;t really notice/use it outside the JavaScriptMVC community so far.
Why should you use it?  StealJS can not only load JavaScript files, but also CSS, CoffeeScript and Less!</description>

      <description>As you can see on my Linkedin profile, I used to work as consultant for 6Wunderkinder, a Berlin based start-up company, last year. My job was to provide training for the developers and help building the initial Web frontend for Wunderkit, their next product after the popular Wunderlist app. Even though I could say a lot about what I liked and didn&amp;#8217;t like about any company I worked with, I&amp;#8217;m never disclosing internal details.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Pattern: Wiki is online</title>

      <description>I recently managed to publish my latest project:
chaoticpattern.net
While reading the book Sync, I felt that this is the right name &amp;#8211; an explanation can be found on the Web site. There is already some blog with the same name, but it does not seem to be very active. The last post is from May 2009. Hope I don&amp;#8217;t cause any confusion.
Chaotic Pattern will be used as an incubator/lab.</description>

      <title>How to contribute to JavaScriptMVC 3.0</title>

      <description>If you are reading this, I can safely assume you know what JavaScriptMVC (JMVC) is, what its features are, and what components it consists of, namely:
 FuncUnit (the test framework) DocumentJS (the documentation engine) jQuery (JavaScriptMVC uses a special fork with added bugfixes) JavaScriptMVC (the core framework) Steal (the code manager / script loader; sometimes referred to as “StealJS”) Phui (component library for JavaScriptMVC, not part of the core)  These partly independent components (together with Selenium) are bundled using git submodules (http://book.</description>

      <title>It’s really hard to talk about JavaScript best practices and JMVC</title>

      <description>I was totally enthusiastic, when I first learned about JavaScriptMVC &amp;#8211; because it brings all the best practices you are accustomed to into the JavaScript world. That means the MVC architecture, Object-oriented development with simulated inheritance, EJS templates, easy testing, OpenAjax support, powerful event delegation and so on.
However, I often have a hard time to convince other developers about those advantages. I guess testing is the easiest one, because no developer would dare to argue against testing, even though many developers don&amp;#8217;t do it or don&amp;#8217;t do it right.</description>

      <title>JavaScriptMVC 1.5 released</title>

      <description>A new stable release of the JavaScriptMVC framework was released yesterday :) Justin Meyer developed it, while working with us on a new Web application. Some features like the new custom events are direct results of this project. He did an excellent job!
New features include:
 Env.js/Shrinksafe based compression: A custom env to simulate the browser. As the browser encounters script tags, it adds them to a collection and then compresses them.</description>

      <title>Ajax and Rich Internet Application FAQ</title>

      <description>Shall I use JSON or XML as AJAX transport format?
There actually is no reason to use XML instead of JSON, if you don&amp;#8217;t plan to use XSLT. JSON is part of JavaScript which has been around since the dark ages of the web. Also, there are very fast server-side JSON implementations and JSON is the more compact protocol, thus saving bandwidth.
Isn&amp;#8217;t XSLT much faster than to use JSON and modify the DOM with JavaScript?</description>

      <title>JavaScript Components</title>
      <link>https://blog.liquidbytes.net/2008/07/javascript-components/</link>

      <description>My blog was a calm place for a while now, because I&amp;#8217;m terribly busy with writing code (like it should be&amp;#8230;). With this posting, I want to present the prototype of JavaScript Components, which are comparable to Swing Components in Java. They make use of the Composite Pattern. That means every Component can act as a container for other Components. Together with Models, Views and a Controller (Event Dispatcher), they can form reusable widgets.</description>
