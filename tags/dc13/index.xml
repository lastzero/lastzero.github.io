      <description>I&amp;#8217;m not known for going to conferences very often, so this year I will do something very special: Attending two conferences! PHP Unconference in September was great fun already. The other one will be Developer Conference in Hamburg, which starts in two days. I know some of the speakers personally (the list is actually quite impressive) and I look forward to see them again. Even Professor Lutz Prechelt will give a talk.</description>
