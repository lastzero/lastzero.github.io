      <description>Yesterday, I migrated my personal math reference to the new Wiki:
http://math.chaoticpattern.net/wiki/index
It is all in German and with my own clumsy comments. Those who read it, will notice that math is a useful tool for me, rather than some kind of art &amp;#8211; although I agree you can look at it as art, if you got the time. That&amp;#8217;s why I tried to compress it as much as possible ;)</description>
