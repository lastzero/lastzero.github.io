      <description>Even though I am the master of procrastination, I managed to fix 3 issues in flot (JS charting plugin for jQuery) and PHPUnit this week. Of course they are hosted on github and everyone who knows me, knows that I hate git because it is sooo different from svn and my brain frequently explodes when I see all the branches and connections between them. Every time I try to explain that to more or less experienced git users, they try to convince me from the opposite.</description>
