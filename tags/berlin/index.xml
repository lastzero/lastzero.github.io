      <description>As you can see on my Linkedin profile, I used to work as consultant for 6Wunderkinder, a Berlin based start-up company, last year. My job was to provide training for the developers and help building the initial Web frontend for Wunderkit, their next product after the popular Wunderlist app. Even though I could say a lot about what I liked and didn&amp;#8217;t like about any company I worked with, I&amp;#8217;m never disclosing internal details.</description>
