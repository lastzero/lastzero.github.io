      <description>What does passion mean for a Software Engineer? Depends on the context. First, and that&amp;#8217;s what start-up companies usually expect from their employes, it means you love the company, the business idea and the team you work with. Some people are also passionate about their Apple computer/phone/tablet in a similar way (the term &amp;#8220;Fanboy&amp;#8221; is frequently used in Web forums to describe this behavior). *
Second, it can mean that you stay ahead of the curve and have strong opinions about how to do your job (independent from the company you&amp;#8217;re currently working for): For example, I&amp;#8217;m obsessed with clean code and unit tests.</description>

      <description>As you can see on my Linkedin profile, I used to work as consultant for 6Wunderkinder, a Berlin based start-up company, last year. My job was to provide training for the developers and help building the initial Web frontend for Wunderkit, their next product after the popular Wunderlist app. Even though I could say a lot about what I liked and didn&amp;#8217;t like about any company I worked with, I&amp;#8217;m never disclosing internal details.</description>
