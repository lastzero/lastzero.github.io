      <description>Today, I prepared for the upcoming PHP/JS conferences and had a look at the mysterious bug #883 of Google Chrome and those related to it. Also I read though SquirrelFish source, which is used by Safari 4.
The reason for the odd behavior of Chrome seems to be a if/else construct that is repeated throughout the source of runtime.cc:
// Check if the name is trivially convertible to an index and get // the element if so.</description>

      <description>If somebody ever said, there is no memory leak in Firefox, here&amp;#8217;s the proof:

It can&amp;#8217;t be, that a browser with 4 open tabs requires about 600 MB of memory. That&amp;#8217;s 150 MB per Web site, which seems a bit too much ;)
Safari, by the way, requires 128 MB for 5 open tabs.
 If you find that Firefox&amp;#8217;s memory usage continues to grow after long periods of being open, you may want to consider periodically restarting Firefox to bring the memory usage back to reasonable levels.</description>
