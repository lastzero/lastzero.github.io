      <description>I&amp;#8217;m currently reading The Clean Coder by Robert C. Martin. Here are some of my favorite quotes:
Caffeine &amp;#8220;There is no doubt that some of us can make more efficient use of our focus-manna by consuming moderate amounts of caffeine. But take care. Caffeine also puts a strange jitter on our focus.&amp;#8221;
Arrogance &amp;#8220;Programmers tend to be arrogant, self-absorbed introverts.We didn&amp;#8217;t go into this business because we like people. Most of us got into programming because we prefer to deeply focus on sterile minutia, juggle lots of concepts simultaneously, and in general prove to ourselves that we have brains the size of a planet, all while not having to interact with the messy complexities of other people.</description>
