      <description>The thing is, any time you get a provider in the market that has a predominantly large share of that market, questions start to get asked about their practices, about what their motives are. I desperately hope that they [Google]&amp;#8230;in fact I expect that they will change. They will become as grown up as some of the larger companies around, so in some respects it&amp;#8217;s a predictable thing.

      <description>As people start asking me about that ODBTP adapter for Zend Framework, I will publish it as attachment to this post now. It should work with the latest version of Zend Framework (as reported by a developer). If you want to use it, just copy the files to your include path (make sure the path comes before the ZF path). Of course, you need to install ODBTP as well and add extension=php_odbtp_mssql.</description>
