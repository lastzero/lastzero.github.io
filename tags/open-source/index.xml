      <description>Ha, after almost 3 years, the home page of my (so far) biggest Open Source project AWF-CMS is online again. When I started working for Zend in 2006&amp;frasl;2007, I felt the need to write a version that is based on Zend Framework. Of course I was busy with my customer projects, so that never happened. Even worse, due to a server upgrade, the configuration for the AWF Web site was broken and I didn&amp;#8217;t even find the time to fix that until today.</description>

      <title>JavaScript Components</title>

      <description>My blog was a calm place for a while now, because I&amp;#8217;m terribly busy with writing code (like it should be&amp;#8230;). With this posting, I want to present the prototype of JavaScript Components, which are comparable to Swing Components in Java. They make use of the Composite Pattern. That means every Component can act as a container for other Components. Together with Models, Views and a Controller (Event Dispatcher), they can form reusable widgets.</description>
