      <description>Let me say a few words about Ape, an Ajax push server I came across this week:
http://www.ape-project.org/
Even though the authors say it&amp;#8217;s a stable 1.0 release and &amp;#8220;insanely great&amp;#8221;, there are some issues you should be aware of. I write this in the hope that it helps others to evaluate the server and to give feedback to the developers. The general idea of combining fast C code with JavaScript is very good.</description>

      <description>A new stable release of the JavaScriptMVC framework was released yesterday :) Justin Meyer developed it, while working with us on a new Web application. Some features like the new custom events are direct results of this project. He did an excellent job!
New features include:
 Env.js/Shrinksafe based compression: A custom env to simulate the browser. As the browser encounters script tags, it adds them to a collection and then compresses them.</description>

      <description>Shall I use JSON or XML as AJAX transport format?
There actually is no reason to use XML instead of JSON, if you don&amp;#8217;t plan to use XSLT. JSON is part of JavaScript which has been around since the dark ages of the web. Also, there are very fast server-side JSON implementations and JSON is the more compact protocol, thus saving bandwidth.
Isn&amp;#8217;t XSLT much faster than to use JSON and modify the DOM with JavaScript?</description>
