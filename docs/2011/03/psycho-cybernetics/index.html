            <p>It is always interesting to see, what we &#8220;forgot&#8221; during history. One of the these things is, without a doubt, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener">Cybernetics</a> (which in turn is a child of the 2nd world war) and maybe even the origin of computers (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>), which is closely coupled to that.</p>

<p>While passing by a second-hand bookstore in Evanston, IL I saw the book Psycho-Cybernetics in the window, which was published in 1960, 12 years after Cybernetics was published by Norbert Wiener. Apparently Cybernetics was a popular and well-known term at that time.</p>

<p>The flight back to Germany will give opportunity to read through this book, but the preface already looks promising:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our present state of self-confidence and poise is the result of what we have &#8220;experienced&#8221; rather than what we have learned intellectually. [&#8230;] Actual, real-life experience can be a hard and ruthless teacher.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some might say this is common sense, but many people don&#8217;t act like that and IMO our schools still don&#8217;t focus enough on creative experiencing but rather try to go the intellectual way of learning everything out of a book.</p>

<p>Just as a side note: As an outcome of the cold war, the Cybernetics hype was replaced by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> hype. At least this was mentioned in the Wikipedia article about AI, which is more than I expected:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology">neurology</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">cybernetics</a>. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Grey_Walter" title="W. Grey Walter">W. Grey Walter</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot)" title="Turtle (robot)">turtles</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Beast">Johns Hopkins Beast</a>. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University">Princeton University</a> and the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_Club">Ratio Club</a> in England.<sup id="cite_ref-AI.27s_immediate_precursors_20-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-AI.27s_immediate_precursors-20">[21]</a></sup> By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Cybernetics_and_brain_simulation" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What they don&#8217;t write is that it was abandoned for political and financial rather than scientific reasons.</p>

<p>The von Neumann architecture could be replaced by new massive-parallel architectures built around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor">memristor</a>, see one of my last posts and then, maybe we can finally <a href="http://www.singularity.com/">transfer our minds into a computer</a> ;)</p>

<p>Anyhow, I just think it&#8217;s sad how much knowledge and context gets lost over time, despite the fact that we&#8217;re living in a knowledge-society and the Internet enabled us to get all the information we want. But people are (of course) interested in hypes and books written decades ago don&#8217;t seem to be relevant anymore.</p>
