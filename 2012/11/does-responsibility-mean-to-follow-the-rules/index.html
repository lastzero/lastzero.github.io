When we grow up, we get taught that responsibility means to <strong>follow the established rules</strong> of society (including our parents and the various educational institutions), which indeed <strong>is a good start</strong>. Now, the challenges we face in large software projects are much <strong>more complex</strong> and dynamic. The solutions can not be found in <strong>simple rules</strong> like doing your homework every day. Still, managers and also (to my surprise) many engineers are looking for <strong>simple panaceas</strong> to solve their problems automatically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>_Agile_ processes are not a _panacea_ and they are not _easy_ to implement. [&#8230;] These processes focus on code rather than documentation calling themselves agile because, unlike the traditional processes, they are adaptable, not rigid.</p>

<p><cite>Everette R. Keith, New York University, <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring03/V22.0474-001/lectures/agile/AgileDevelopmentDifferentApproach.pdf">Agile Software Development Processes</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Organizations and projects are <strong>highly dynamic systems</strong> that need to be <strong>understood</strong> and <strong>analyzed</strong>. You can then start to react and <strong>make changes</strong> that hopefully lead in the right direction. The agile manifesto says &#8220;we value <strong>responding to change</strong> over following a plan&#8221;.</p>

<p>The idea behind true responsibility is to be able to <strong>observe</strong> and <strong>control</strong> the system you are responsible for. In cybernetics, it is called a <strong>feedback loop</strong>. This is exactly why implementing an agile process is the opposite of <strong>following the rules correctly</strong>. If you want to be successful, you must <strong>measure the results</strong> of your actions and <strong>adapt the rules</strong> accordingly.</p>

<p>If you put people in a <strong>responsible position</strong> but don&#8217;t give them <strong>full control</strong>, you either cause a <strong>conflict</strong> or, if you were successful, you <strong>block their natural problem solving mechanism</strong>. This usually happens before systems <strong>fail badly</strong>.</p>

<p>It is true, some common rules in the area of software engineering and agile management require <strong>pedantic exactness</strong> and <strong>rigor</strong> to lead to good results. But <strong>professional responsibility</strong> starts with <strong>measuring</strong> these results and <strong>adapting the rules</strong> accordingly. Although there are many <strong>well-written books</strong> out there, finding solutions that work has a lot to do with <strong>practical experience</strong>. Managers and team members must give the <strong>freedom to control</strong> to those, who are supposed to be responsible.</p>
